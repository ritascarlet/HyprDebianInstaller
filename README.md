# HyprDebian
Simple setup script for installation Hyprland On Debian(sid)

I love you very much Debian and works Vaxerski, so I decided to write a simple script (really very simple), which collects all the components from the source code. 
(wayland, wayland-protocols, libdisplay-info, hyprlang, hyprcursor, hyprwayland-scanner, aquamarine)

And will install sddm without kde, kitty, wofi and hyprpaper for easy start

The script always tries to collect the latest and most stable releases, so don't worry about incompatibility 

It is recommended to set it to CLEAN debian sid And yes, debian sid more stable, more comfortable and safer than the same testing

Okay, I wrote a lot. Let's get started with the installation.

git clone https://github.com/ritascarlet/HyprDebianInstaller.git

cd HyprDebianInstaller

chmod +x HyprDebian.sh

sudo ./HyprDebian.sh

By the way, run only from root

If you want to contribute your idea for the script, then say so, don't be shy. Love and hugs to all<3


I also compiled a small script for installing the best version of Nvidia drivers<3
